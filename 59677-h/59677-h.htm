<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Kien</span> Lung was the fourth Emperor of the Tartar dynasty,
which now possesses the throne of China. When the annexed
Sketch was taken he was eighty-three years of age, but had
all the appearance of a hale, vigorous man of sixty. Indeed
his whole life had been spent in the active discharge of
public business, and in the violent exercise of hunting and
shooting in the wild regions of Tartary, which he continued
with unabated zeal almost to the period of life above mentioned.
He always commenced public business at two or
three in the morning, and gave audience to foreign ambassadors
at that early hour, whether in winter or summer, and he
generally retired to rest at sunset; and to this invariable
habit of rising and retiring at an early hour, he attributed
much of his healthy and vigorous constitution.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> Leu-tzé, or fishing cormorant of China, is the <i>pelicanus
sinensis</i>, and resembles very much the common cormorant
of England, which, we are told by naturalists, was
once trained up to catch fish, pretty much in the same
manner as those of China are. They are exceedingly
expert in taking fish, and pursue them under water with
great eagerness. They are taken out, on the rivers and
lakes, in boats or bamboo rafts; and though sent on the
chace after long fasting, they are so well trained that they
rarely swallow any of the fish they take until they are permitted
to do so by their masters. Many thousand families
in China earn their subsistence by means of these birds.</p>

and when honest, which is a quality not common among
them, they are invaluable. They are rather slow, and do
not like to be put out of their way, but they do their work
well and neatly. Every European resident at Canton and
Macao has Chinese servants, which on the whole, are preferable
to any other race of Orientals. They are sometimes
brought over to England, but are seldom happy till they
get back to their own country, which has the same kind of
charm to them as the vallies of Switzerland had to the
natives of that once happy country.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>All</span> officers of state, whether civil or military, from the
highest to the lowest, have been named by the early Portuguese
writers <i>mandarins</i>, from a word in their own
language, <i>mandar</i>, to command; and this name, improper
as it is, has preserved its ground ever since. The figure
of a bird on the embroidered breast-plate of the annexed
figure points him out as a civilian. A military officer wears
the figure of an animal resembling the tiger. The degree
of rank, whether civil or military, is marked by a small
globe on the top of the cap, opake red coral distinguishing
the highest, and brass the lowest rank: the intermediate
colours are transparent red, opake and transparent blue,
opake and transparent white. As a mark of imperial favour,
one, two, or three feathers from the tail of the peacock are
appended to the back part of the bonnet. All officers,
whether civil or military, invariably wear thick-quilted
boots, and, when in their court-dresses, embroidered petticoats.
Most of them wear chains of coral, or agate, or
coloured glass round the neck, as in the annexed figure.</p>

which the large quantities of tin sent from this country is
applied. On the four-legged stool is the pot containing
the sticks of fate, and other paraphernalia belonging to
the temple, and behind it is the tripod in which incense is
sometimes burned. These superstitious rites are performed
several times by the priests every day, but there is no kind
of congregational worship in China. The people pay the
priests for taking care of their present and future fate.</p>

quite ridiculous to see the avidity with which young children
follow a traveller on horseback for the chance of
catching what the animal may emit, which is immediately
caught up, and thrown into the basket; and if the
traveller himself should contribute his portion, it is considered
as more valuable than that from the animal.</p>

China, that disturbances rarely, if ever, happen during the
night. The watch is set at nine, and continues till five in
the morning. A gate is placed at each end of the cross
streets, which are all streight, and at right angles with the
main streets; from each gate a watchman proceeds till he
meets his brother watchman about the middle; at every
half hour he beats the hollow bamboo tube, in his left
hand, with the mallet in the right, striking the same
number of blows as there may be half hours elapsed from
nine o’clock: the blow gives a dead, dull sound, sufficiently
audible, and to a stranger sufficiently disagreeable.
Each watchman is also furnished with a paper lantern.
At the great gates of cities, and at certain distances
in the main streets are guard-houses, at which a party
of soldiers are stationed to aid the police, if necessary;
but this is rarely the case, as, in addition to the common
watch, every tenth housekeeper in every street is made responsible
for the orderly good conduct of his nine neighbours.
In the day time there is plenty of noise, and
quarrelling and scuffling among the lower orders of the

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> priests of <i>Fo</i> in China are the same as the priests of
<i>Boudh</i> are in India, from whence their religion passed into
China in the first century of the Christian æra. The
temples and the monasteries of China swarm with them;
and they practice, ostensibly at least, all the austerities and
mortifications of the several orders of monks in Europe,
and inflict on themselves the same painful, laborious, and
disgusting punishments which the faquirs of India undergo,
either for the love of God, as they would have it supposed,
or to impose on the multitude, as is most probably the real
motive. In China, however, they are generally esteemed
as men of correct morals: and there is reason to believe,
that the calumnies heaped upon them by the Catholic
missionaries are for the most part unfounded, and were
occasioned by the mortification they experienced in finding
their ceremonies, their altars, their images, their dress, to
resemble so very nearly their own.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is scarcely necessary to observe that our umbrellas are
borrowed from the Chinese. The poorest person has one
of these machines to keep off the rain; but in China they
are made of paper, and the wood part is entirely of
bamboo. The hats of the common people are in fact a
kind of umbrella; they are generally made of rice straw
plaited, and so large that they equally defend the face from
the rays of the sun and cover the shoulders from the rain.
That which the priest carries under his arm is small in
proportion of some of those worn by the peasantry. In
moderate weather a Chinese, though close shaved, except
as to the little lock of hair growing from the crown,
generally goes bareheaded.</p>

Their lanterns are as various in shape as in materials. The
most common are of painted paper. The most beautiful
and ornamental of silk gauze, finely painted and
stretched on frames that are not deficient in carving
and curious workmanship, and decorated with tassels of
silk of various colours. Other lanterns are round and cylindrical,
and of one single piece of thin transparent horn,
sometimes of an immense size. At certain times in the
year, but more particularly in the month of February, they
celebrate what has been called the Feast of Lanterns,
when every body in the street carries some transparency or
other made in every possible form: some of them like
fishes, some like beasts of various kinds, and others birds.
Some resemble trees and shrubs, with flowers and fruits,
each in their appropriate colours. Those lanterns borne
by the man in the print are of the most ordinary kind.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> military of China differs, as every thing else differs,
from that of all other nations, in the nature of its establishment,
its occupation, and its dress. They have two distinct
armies, if they may be so called; the one composed entirely
of Tartars, who are stationed in the several provinces
on the Tartar frontier, and occupy all the garrison towns
of the empire; the other composed of Chinese, who are
parcelled out in the smaller towns and hamlets to keep the
peace, by acting as constables, subordinate collectors of
the taxes, guards to the granaries, and assisting in various
ways the civil magistrate. Along the public roads, canals
and rivers, are placed, at certain intervals, small square
guard-houses, at which are stationed from six to twelve
men, who are employed in settling disputes upon the
rivers or roads, and also in conveying the public dispatches.
When a foreign ambassador or any of their own mandarins
travel, these soldiers turn out in their holiday dresses
with their streamers stuck in the back, as in the annexed
figure. The breast-plate and shoulder-guards are nothing
more than cotton stuffed with wadding, and the
helmet, which looks so fierce, is made only of paste-board.
The Chinese matchlocks resemble so much the old common
matchlock of the Portuguese, that it has been supposed
these people first introduced them into China, where
however it is sufficiently determined, gunpowder was in
familiar use many centuries before any communication was
known to exist between this country and Europe. In some
of the larger matchlocks there is a fork to support the
piece, and by sticking it in the ground to give it the degree
elevation that may be required.</p>

the same direction, applied a sail to assist the progress of
their land carriages; but the late British Embassy has furnished
us with the precise manner in which these sails are
applied, and it appears that they are meant only to aid a

every opportunity of throwing off their ceremonial garb,
and assume a thin loose gown, tied with a belt round the
waist. Their summer-hat is also made of light rice straw.
The head is not encumbered with hair, which all ranks
and ages shave close off, leaving only a small lock
hanging down behind. The use of fans is universal.
Even the military, when drawn out on parade-duty, make
use of fans. It will be observed in this figure, that the

of manufacture unknown in China.</p>

In fact, no pains whatever appear to be taken either for
improving the breed, or by attention to their food, cleanliness,
or regular exercise, to increase the size, strength,
or spirit of the animal. A currycomb, or any substitute
for it, is unknown in China. Indeed horses are not much
in use. Wherever the nature of the country admits of
canals or navigable rivers, travelling and conveyance of
every kind are principally performed on the water. A
single horse suffices to draw a mandarin’s carriage, which

musician consists in beating a sort of tambourine, or rather
a shallow kettle-drum, with a mallet held between the toes
of one foot, while he strikes a pair of cymbals with the
other, and, at the same time plays upon a sort of guitar
accompanied by his voice. It would seem also that he
is equally skilled in wind instruments, of which a flute and
trumpet make their appearance out of the mouth of his bag;
a pair of rattles connected by a piece of riband lie on the
ground, and near them a hollow piece of wood, nearly
heart-shaped, which, when struck with a mallet, emits a
dull disagreeable sound, like the hollow bamboo carried
by the watchman, for which this is sometimes substituted. A
Chinese band always play in unison, and never in parts:
this indeed is an art they have not yet reached, and those
few who have heard European harmony pretend to dislike
it. A Chinese ear is best gratified with the sounds of noisy
instruments, as gongs, kettle-drums, shrill trumpets,
jingling bells and cymbals, or with the faint and reedy
tones, scarcely audible, of a little bamboo organ, which
swell and die away not unlike those of an Eolian harp.</p>

It is still preferred by them to the matchlock; and the
Tartars are so fond of it, that it forms an essential part of
the education of the young princes of the blood. Their
bows are large, and require a considerable degree of
strength, as well as a peculiar knack to string them. Even
the Emperor wears a ring of agate on the right thumb for
the string to press against in drawing the bow, which is
the weapon he uses every summer in hunting tigers and
other wild beasts in the forests of Tartary. When the
troops are drawn out on parade-duty, not only the superior
officers carry colours, but a small flag is stuck on the back
of every fifth, seventh, or ninth man. The characters on

The piece of hollow wood in his hand is struck to draw
attention, and the label on his back describes his condition,
which is not exactly such as in other countries would
excite much compassion. It states his unfortunate situation,
as having no children to take care of him, to console
him in affliction, to give him food when hungry, or medicine
when sick. The want of children is considered in
China as the greatest of all misfortunes, and is in reality so,
as by the moral precepts of that nation, which have all the
force of law, filial piety is looked upon as the first of moral
virtues; and, however poor a child may be, he is bound to
share his earnings with his aged parents.</p>

expose for sale to any censor appointed by government; but
then he must take his chance to suffer in his person all the
consequences that may result from the impression that may
be made on the minds of the civil officers as to the tendency
of the work. A libel against the government, an immoral
or indecent book, would subject both printer and publisher
to certain punishment both in his person and purse. The
Chinese have not made any great progress in literature, and
still less in the sciences: they most excel in the history of
their own country, in morality, and in practical jurisprudence.
Their dramatic works are constructed on the same
model as those of the Greeks, to which it is hardly necessary
to add they are infinitely inferior. Their novels and
moral tales are better; but the works in most esteem are
the four classical books supposed to be written or compiled
by Confucius. Their printing is not performed by moveable
types, like ours, but by wooden blocks the size of the

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> annexed figure, either from the striped dress, or the
furious looking head painted on the shield, has been called
a tiger of war; but he is not so fierce as he appears to be,
or as the name would imply; indeed the Chinese admit
that the monstrous face, on the basket-work shield, is
intended to frighten the enemy, and make him run away;
like another Gorgon’s head to petrify those who look upon
it. This corps of infantry, in its exercise, assumes all
kinds of whimsical attitudes, jumping about and tumbling
over each other, like so many mountebanks. Indeed the
whole of the Chinese military tactics are as absurd as they
are ridiculous. When an army is drawn out, it must represent
the heavens, or the earth, or the moon, or the five
planets, or the five-clawed dragon, or mystical tortoise.
Père Amiot, a French missionary, has been at the trouble
of collecting or composing the military tactics of China,
which fill a large quarto volume.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>There</span> is every reason to believe, that Punch and his wife
were originally natives of China; and that all our puppet-shows
were brought from that country. The little theatre,
above the head of a man concealed behind a curtain, is
precisely Chinese. <i>Les ombres Chinoises</i> still bear the
name of their inventors; but the annexed representation of
a puppet-showman is somewhat different from both, and is
the simple origin of the <i>Fantoccini</i>, which consists in
giving motion to the puppets, by means of springs attached
to particular parts of the figures. These little dancing
puppets are not merely exhibited for the amusement of
children; they furnish entertainment for the Emperor and
his court, and more especially for the ladies who, from
their recluse mode of life, are easily diverted with any kind
of amusement, however childish. We find from Mr.
Barrow, that a puppet-show was one species of entertainment
given to Lord Macartney and his suite at the Emperor’s
palace of Gehol in Tartary.</p>

areca-box and his tobacco pipe, attends him on all occasions,
fans him while asleep; and, if report speaks truth,
serves him for other unworthy purposes. Every mandarin
has one or more of these kind of boys whom, even in

decorous. The upper vest, worn by the person in the

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>It</span> is a peculiar feature in all the Oriental nations, that the
most beautiful specimens of workmanship in the various
arts are made with the most simple and at the same time
most clumsy tools. The artificers moreover are rarely
fixed, or settled in a workshop convenient for their purposes,
but generally travel about the country carrying
their shop and apparatus with them. The annexed figure
represents an itinerant smith, who has more tools than
almost any other artificer of China, and yet performs his
work the worst. Their cast iron is light and good, but
their manufactures of wrought iron are very indifferent:
they can neither make a hinge, nor a lock, nor even a nail
that can be called good. The bellows of the smith is a
box with a valvular piston, which, when not in use, serves
as a seat, and also to contain his tools. The barber also
makes a seat of his basket; the joiner uses his rule as a
walking-stick, and the same chest that holds his tools
serves him as a bench to work upon: such are the expedients
which thousands resort to, both in India and
China.</p>

year at certain periods dutiful children assemble at the
tomb of their parents or ancestors, to make oblations of
flowers, or fruit, or pieces of gilt paper, or whatever else
they consider as likely to be acceptable to the manes of the
departed. Their mourning dress consists of a garment of
Nanquin cotton, or canvas, of the coarsest kind. Some of
the monuments erected over the dead are by no means
inelegant; like their bridges and triumphal arches, they
are very much varied, and made apparently without any
fixed design or proportion. The semicircular or the horse-shoe
form, like that in the print before which the mourner
is kneeling, appeared to be the most common.</p>

the shoulder. If a Chinese should only have one basket to
carry, he is sure to get a log of wood, or a large stone to
counterpoise it at the opposite end, thus preferring to carry
a double weight rather than place it on the head, or the
shoulder, or across the arm. The Chinese are in appearance
far from exhibiting any signs of great muscular

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>It</span> is, perhaps, more proper to call the annexed figure, the

comedian, than “a female comedian,” as women have
been prohibited from appearing publicly on the stage
since the late Emperor, Kien Lung, took an actress for one
of his inferior wives. Female characters are now therefore
performed either by boys or eunuchs. The whole
dress is supposed to be that of the ancient Chinese, and
indeed is not very different from that of the present day.
The young ladies of China display considerable taste and
fancy in their head-dresses which are much decorated with
feathers, flowers, and beads as well as metallic ornaments
in great variety of form. Their outer garments are richly
embroidered, and are generally the work of their own
hands, a great part of their time being employed in this
way. If it was not a rigid custom of the country, to confine
to their apartments the better class of females, the
unnatural cramping of their feet, while infants, is quite
sufficient to prevent them from stirring much abroad, as it
is with some difficulty they are able to hobble along; yet
such is the force of fashion, that a lady with her feet of
the natural size would be despised, and at once classed
among the vulgar.</p>

By means of poles attached to each other the Emperor’s

<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> practice of smoking tobacco is not more common, at

the areca nut, mixed with chunam, or lime made of
shells, and wrapped up in a leaf of the betel pepper.
Indeed this compound masticatory is in universal use
throughout all India, the Oriental Islands, Cochin-china,
and Tonquin. In addition to the little purse which every
Chinese wears suspended from his belt as an appendage to
his tobacco pipe and to hold the ingredients for smoking,
whether tobacco, or opium, or both, he generally carries
another to contain areca nuts broken into small fragments:
the other materials, the betel leaf, and chunam are to be
met with in every little eating shop, and on almost every
stall in the bazar, or market, and are among the most
common articles carried about the streets for sale. The
areca tree is one of the palm tribe, with a tuft of leaves
surmounting a stem as straight and beautifully shaped as
the shaft of a Corinthian pillar. It requires a warm
climate, and grows freely in the southern provinces of
China, but is common in every part of India and the
Oriental Islands.</p>

on the shaft in the aukward manner here represented. They
have no springs, nor any seat in the inside, the persons
using them always sitting cross-legged on a cushion at the
bottom. In these carts the gentlemen of Lord Macartney’s
embassy who had not horses, were <i>accommodated</i>, over a
stone pavement full of rutts and holes. When ladies use
them, a bamboo screen is let down in front to prevent their

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>The</span> very general use of tobacco throughout the whole
extensive empire of China, and the still more extensive
regions of Tartary, would seem to contradict the commonly
received opinion, that this herb is indigenous only
in America. One can hardly suppose that the Chinese,
who are so remarkably averse from the introduction of any
thing novel, would, in the course of three centuries, have
brought the custom of smoking into universal use; yet so
it is; men of all ranks and all ages; women, whatever
their condition in life may be, and children even of both
sexes of eight or ten years of age, are furnished with the
necessary apparatus for smoking tobacco. In walking the
streets, in almost all the occupations of life, the tobacco pipe
is seldom out of the mouth. When not in use it
is placed in a small pouch suspended from the girdle;
and another appendage is a small silken purse generally
attached to the pipe for containing opium, areca nut, or
some other masticatory. The tube of the pipe is generally
made of bamboo, and the cap or bowl of the metal called
tutanague or porcelain. The shape and structure of this
machine are strongly marked with originality, being unlike
those in use among any other people; but the plant itself
is, we understand, of a different species to any of those
found in America, which is perhaps the strongest proof of
all, that the custom of smoking has existed in China from
time immemorial.</p>

boats and barges of various kinds, some occupied in carrying
articles of provisions and merchandize, others in
conveying passengers, some in feeding and rearing ducks,
and others in fishing. Some of these vessels have masts
and sails, others are forced forwards with large sculls or
pushed on with poles, some are dragged along by men,
and others, but very rarely, by horses. Near the head of
each vessel is suspended in some convenient place, one of
those noisy instruments well known in this country by the
name of gong, which is used to regulate the motions of
the trackers, and to give notice to other vessels of the
approach and intentions of the one that beats the signal.
Where a large fleet is about to come to anchor or make
fast for the night, there is a tremendous crash of gongs
from all quarters; the meaning of each of which is distinctly
understood by the Chinese, from the peculiar mode
in which each is struck.</p>

these wires are strung in one compartment five, and in the
other two, moveable balls. The principle is something of
the same kind as that of the <i>abacus</i> of the Romans, and is
with some little variation still made use of in Russia. It has
been observed, that in weighing several thousand chests of
tea, or bales of goods, at Canton, the Chinese accountant

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>By</span> the military emblem on the breast-plate, the annexed
figure of a stage player must be intended to represent a
great general or some military hero famous in the annals
of China. Noisy music and extravagant gestures are the
characteristic features of the Chinese stage, of which it
would lead us into too long a detail to convey any intelligible
account; and we prefer, therefore, to refer to the
curious and interesting descriptions which have been furnished
on this subject by Lord Macartney, Sir George
Staunton and Mr. Barrow. We have only to add, that the
figure was sketched from the life.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>There</span> is little to observe on the annexed engraving. It
represents a groupe of the common peasantry of the country
eating their rice. The particular employment of these,
here designated, is that of tracking barges on the canals;
the pieces of wood lying by them being those which they
place across the chest to drag forward the vessels. It will
be seen from the other prints, that the common mode of
carrying burthens is that of swinging baskets from the two
extremities of a bamboo, which is laid by the middle
across the shoulders.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>This</span> gentleman is a sort of appendage to a man in power.
Some half-dozen of them generally precede a mandarin of
rank when he goes in procession, but more especially when
he attends a tribunal of justice. Their peculiar province
seems to be that of keeping off the crowd. The feathers
they wear in their tall conical hats are from three to six feet
in length, and are apparently the tail feathers of a peculiar
species of pheasant, which is represented as very scarce.
Some of them wear the tail feathers of the argus pheasant.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>Piercing</span> the ear with various sharp instruments is among
the punishments of the Chinese. A man who had been
insolent to one of the suite of Lord Macartney’s embassy,
was sentenced to receive fifty strokes from the pant-zee or
bamboo, in addition to having his hand pinned to his ear
by an iron wire, which was said to have been inflicted
immediately after the bastinade.</p>

<p class='c013'>The middle figure is an inferior officer of the police,
who holds a painted board on which the crime is exhibited
to spectators; the other personage is a mandarin reproving
the culprit.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>There</span> is little more to be observed of the present engraving
than this: that whatever wares, goods, or merchandize
are exposed to sale in the open air, which in the open
plains, as well in the broad streets of cities, is very much
the case, the vender and the articles themselves are, during
the summer months, protected from the rays of the sun by
a large umbrella, which is generally square, like that in
the print. Some hundreds of similar stands and umbrellas
were displayed on a plain near the spot where the embassy
disembarked, within the mouth of the Pei-ho; the little
booths, if they may be so termed, being generally well
stored with sweet-meats and sliced water-melons laid upon
ice. The poorest peasant in China carries an umbrella,
either to defend him against the rays of the sun, or heavy
rains.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='sc'>At</span> certain distances, more or less remote according to the
nature of the country, along the roads, and the banks of
the interior navigations, are placed small parties of soldiers
from five or six to a dozen, and sometimes more. They
are employed in conveying the public dispatches, and in
assisting the magistrates to quell disturbances. The
immense army of China is for the most part parcelled out
in this way. Near each of these posts is a tall wooden
building from whence they can see and communicate by
signals with the next stations. The men till the ground,
and perform other kinds of labour; but are always expected
to turn out in their holiday dress when an embassador or any
of their <i>ta-zin</i> or great men happen to pass the station, on
which occasion they generally fire three little petards stuck
into the ground with the muzzle upwards as a salute.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
